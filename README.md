ðŸ‘‰My Learnings and Projects of CSS while following full course on CSS by CodeWithHarry.

ðŸ‘‰Important Links:
1) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

ðŸ‘‰Important Recommendations:
1) Install Mozilla FireFox Browser for CSS as it offers better DevTools for CSS

ðŸ‘‰My Learnings during entire course:
1) Try to apply styles with Classes as much as possible and try to define some general styles so you can always reuse them.
2) HSL : Hue,Saturation,Lightness
3) More Learnings are complied in my notes in form of images which will be uploaded in Notes Folder
